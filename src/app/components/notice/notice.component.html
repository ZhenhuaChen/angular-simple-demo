                Have you looked for sales, coupons or generic versions? 
                There’s no point in paying more than you have to.
                Taking the time to research also can prevent impulse purchases that you may regret. 
                However, a sale price isn’t always a reason to buy now. 
                The discount might not be worth it if the purchase will throw off your spending plan or put you in debt

                Could your money be better spend on meeting an immediate need?

                but it shouldn’t come at the expense of something you truly need today
